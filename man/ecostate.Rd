\arguments{
\item{taxa}{Character vector of taxa included in model.}

\item{years}{Integer-vector of years included in model}

\item{catch}{long-form data frame with columns \code{Mass}, \code{Year}
and  \code{Taxon}}

\item{biomass}{long-form data frame with columns \code{Mass}, \code{Year}
and  \code{Taxon}, where \code{Mass} is assumed to have the same units
as \code{catch}}

\item{PB}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
ratio of production to biomass for each taxon}

\item{QB}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
ratio of consumption to biomass for each taxon}

\item{B}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
starting (or fixed) value for equilibrium biomass for each taxon}

\item{DC}{numeric-matrix with rownames and colnames matching \code{taxa},
where each column provides the diet proportion for a given predator}

\item{X}{numeric-matrix with rownames and colnames matching \code{taxa},
where each element gives the vulnerability parameter for a given
interaction.}

\item{type}{character-vector with names matching \code{taxa} and
elements \code{c("auto","hetero","detritus")},
indicating whether each taxon is a primary producer, consumer/predator, or
detritus, respectively.}

\item{U}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
proportion of consumption that is unassimilated and therefore
exported to detritus}

\item{fit_B}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which equilibrium
biomass is estimated as a fixed effect}

\item{fit_Q}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which the catchability
coefficient is estimated as a fixed effect}

\item{fit_B0}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which the ratio of initial
to equilibrium biomass is estimated as a fixed effect}

\item{fit_eps}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which the
model should estimate annual process errors in dB/dt}

\item{log_prior}{A user-provided function that takes as input the list of
parameters \code{out$obj$env$parList()} where \code{out} is the output from
\code{ecostate()}, and returns the log-prior probability.  For example
\code{log_prior = function(p) dnorm( p$logq_i[1], mean=0, sd=0.1, log=TRUE)}
specifies a lognormal prior probability for the catchability coefficient
for the first \code{taxa} with logmean of zero and logsd of 0.1}

\item{control}{Output from \code{\link[=ecostate_control]{ecostate_control()}}, used to define user
settings.}

Estimate parameters for an EcoState model

\details{
All \code{taxa} must be included in \code{QB}, \code{PB}, \code{B}, and \code{DC},
but additional taxa can be in \code{QB}, \code{PB}, \code{B}, and \code{DC} that
are not in \code{taxa}.  So \code{taxa} can be used to redefine the set of modeled
species without changing other inputs
