Description: Fits a state-space extension of Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE)
	to time-series of catch and biomass.  EwE is a widely used
	mass-balance model for biomass dynamics in aquatic ecosystems.
	EcoState fits biological parameters (e.g., equilibrium mass)
	and measurement parameters (e.g., catchability coefficients)
	jointly with residual variation in process errors.
